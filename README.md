# Marketing Funnel Analysis with Google Sheets

## üìã Project Overview

This repository contains a detailed case study of **Marketing Funnel Analysis** performed on a dataset provided by [Olist](https://www.olist.com), Brazil‚Äôs largest department store marketplace. The analysis focuses on understanding the flow of Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) through the sales funnel, from initial contact to closed deals, using Google Sheets.

### üîç Primary Goal

* Demonstrate how to perform common analyses on a marketing funnel.

### üéØ Secondary Goal

* Practice and showcase advanced Google Sheets skills: formulas, pivot tables, and charts.

## üìä Dataset Description

The project leverages two linked datasets:

1. **MQL Dataset**

   * Contains information on 8,000 randomly sampled Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) who requested contact from June 1, 2017, to June 1, 2018.
   * Features include `lead_id`, `seller_id`, `lead_origin`, `lead_type`, `business_segment`, `date_contacted`, and anonymized behavior profiles.

2. **Closed Deals Dataset**

   * Captures outcomes of MQLs that progressed to the sales stage where deals were either won or lost.
   * Contains `seller_id`, `date_closed`, and `deal_status` ("Won" or "Lost").

These datasets can also be joined with the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist via `seller_id` to enrich the analysis with order and revenue information.

## üõ† Analysis Workflow

All analysis was performed in Google Sheets. The core steps are:

1. **Data Preparation**

   * Imported both CSV files (`mql_data.csv`, `closed_deals.csv`) into separate tabs.
   * Performed a **JOIN** (VLOOKUP) to link closed-deal outcomes to MQL records by `seller_id`.

2. **Pivot Tables & Charts**

   * **Lead Origin Analysis**

     * Created a pivot table summarizing total MQLs and won deals by `lead_origin`.
     * Added a combo chart (bars + line) to compare volumes and conversion rates.

   * **Monthly Trends**

     * Built a pivot table with `month_contacted` as rows and count of MQLs as values, broken down by `lead_origin`.
     * Added a stacked bar chart to visualize MoM volumes by origin.
     * Created another pivot to calculate average `days_to_close` by month and visualized it with a line chart.

   * **Lead Type & Business Segment**

     * Generated pivot tables for `lead_type` and `business_segment` against count of closed deals.
     * Added bar charts to highlight top-performing categories.

3. **Recommendations**

   * Based on the findings, defined an **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)** and proposed targeted marketing strategies for high-value segments.
